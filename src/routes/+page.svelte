    Depicted as a diminutive, one-eyed monster with a wisecracking veneer, Mike is an employee of Monsters, Incorporated, where he works closely with his longtime partner/best friend Sulley.
    Mike's world gets turned upside down when a human girl (nicknamed "Boo") enters the monster world.
    Teaming up with Sulley to return Boo to her world, Mike uncovers a company conspiracy and helps solve an energy crisis that plagues the entire city of Monstropolis
